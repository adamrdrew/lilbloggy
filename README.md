# Lil Bloggy
#### An itty-bitty teenie-weenie tinny-little blogging app!

Lil Bloggy is a simple and minimal blogging web app that's designed to do only what it needs to, and to look good while doing it! Lil Bloggy doesn't solve any heretofore unsolved problems and it doesn't bring anything new or radical to the table. I don't expect anyone else will ever use. I wanted to start blogging and felt that, as a web app developer, it would be pretty silly to use someone else's package when a blog would be a fun little project to take on! That said, if anyone finds it useful that would be the icing on the cake!
